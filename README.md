Theme Suite for Gnome, XFCE and Budgie DE. This is a spinoff of my previous icon set Royal Z which are based on Papirus.
It's highly recommendable to use Plank with this theme.

The icon theme is based on Papirus which can be found here: https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/

The GTK theme is a mod based on Graphite gtk theme which can be found here: https://github.com/vinceliuice/Graphite-gtk-theme
